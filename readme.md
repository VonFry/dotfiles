# dotfiles

These files are only for myself. I suggest those who want to use it that please think of it as a reference and don't use
it directly.

It contains developing environment and some test environment. So the setup file also can be used for server (without
services' configure).

## mirror

Becase of I'm in China, most of mirror is used with tuna or ustc by default.

Here is a list of used mirror with this repo. Some things like `~/.cabal/config` which aren't contain in the repo should be set by yourself.

- [ ustc ] homebrew.git & homebrew-core & homebrew-cask & homebrew-bottle
- [ tuna ] hackage & stackage ( without `cabal`)
- [ tuna ] elpa
- [ ustc ] rubygems
- [ ustc ] pypi

## system
- [x] macOS
- [ ] Gentoo
- [ ] Fedora ( No longer maintain. )

## editor
- [X] Vim
- [ ] Neovim ( Emmmm... )
- [X] Emacs

## main lang & tools
- orgmode & latex
- C/C++ (clang/llvm)
- Haskell (ghc & stack)
- Lisp
- Ruby ( chenv )
- Python3 ( No longer maintain. )
- Web (js, html, css/sass, ts)

The other languages are also supposed in system and editor, but they aren't used usally so they haven't a complete
developing environment.
