# dotfiles

These files only for myself.

It contains developing environment and some test environment. So the setup file also can be used for server (without
services' configure).

## system
- [x] macOS
- [ ] Gentoo
- [ ] Fedora ( No longer maintain. )

## editor
- [X] Vim
- [ ] Neovim ( Emmmm... )
- [X] Emacs

## main lang & tools
- C/C++
- Haskell
- Lisp
- Ruby
- Python3

The other languages are also supposed in system and editor, but they aren't used usally so they haven't a complete
developing environment.
